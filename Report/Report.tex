\begin{abstract}
    This report explores the \textit{influential hypothesis} - a minority of individuals, called 
    influentials, who can spread innovations to an exceptional number of peers are important to 
    the spread of ideas/innovations. We explore this idea by performing computer simulations 
    modelling the interpersonal influence process under various conditions and on real social networks. 
    It was found that the importance of influentials in initiation or spread of ideas/innovations depended on the degree distribution of the network which suggests a reexamination of the \textit{influential hypothesis}.

\section{Introduction}

The spread of influence is a well studied phenomena in social science and diffusion research 
that looks to understand how influence is spread and what factors contribute to large cascades
of influence within a population. 
This phenomena can be found in many domains such as the circulation of news by the media, the 
adoption of new technologies, and the promotion of products by social media influencers.
One hypothesis on how innovations are spread is called the \textit{influential hypothesis}\cite{Influential},
which suggests that a minority of individuals called \textit{influentials} are able to spread 
ideas/innovations to an exceptional number of peers. 
However, this model does not explain the characteristics of influentials or precisely how 
responsible they are in the cascade of influence on the (non-influential) population.

In this report, we argue that it is unclear what characteristics underpin influentials and 
whether they can be attributed to the adoption of social changes, new technologies, cultural 
fads and other diffusion processes.
By performing a series of computer simulations of influence spread on various network models, it was found that 
there are instances where influentials show greater responsibility in the spread of influences.
However, under other conditions it was found that influentials are only marginally more important
than the average individual. 
Although our models are simplifications of the complexities of reality, our results highlights
the importance of population interconnectedness in dictating the responsibility of influentials
in the cascade of influence.

\section{Interpersonal Influence Model}

For our model of the spread of influence, we assume that every individual makes a binary decision
on an innovation $X$ such as decision $A$ or $B$. Moreover, we assume that the innovation exhibits \textit{positive externalities}
meaning the probability of an individual choosing $B$ over $A$ increases with the number of 
people choosing $B$. While this model is not fully generalised, as it excludes negative externality 
behaviours and innovations with multiple decisions, it is a reasonable general case to consider. 
For example, in marketing and diffusion research, positive externalities arise in many areas of 
research such as network effects, learning from others, and conformity 
pressures \cite{Influential}.

\subsection{Threshold Model}
A simple model to capture the aforementioned behaviour is to represent each individual $i$ by a node,
which can be in one of two discrete states $\{ 0, 1\}$, with a \textit{threshold rule} $\phi_i$. 
An individual in state $1$ is said to be influenced by an innovation while an 
individual in state $0$ is uninfluenced by an innovation.
Defining $p_i$ to be the proportion of node $i$'s neighbours who are influenced (in state $1$), then 
the probability of $i$ being influenced (in state $1$) is given by
\[ P[\text{Node } i \text{ in state } 1] = 
\begin{cases}
    1 & p_i \geq \phi_i \\
    0 & p_i < \phi_i
\end{cases} \tag{Threshold Rule} \]
where $\phi_i \in [0,1]$ refers to the minimum proportion of $i$'s neighbours that need to be influenced for $i$ to be influenced. 
Intuitively, $\phi_i$ refers to individual $i$'s willingness/ease to be influenced by their neighbours.
For simplicity, we assume every individual's susceptibility to be influenced is the same meaning for every individual $i$ we have $\phi_i = \phi$ for some fixed $\phi$.

\subsection{Influence Networks}
Alongside the rule describing how individuals are able to influence each other, we also need to 
describe who influences whom.
However, social networks are not yet fully understood in terms of their network properties. 
Consequently, we make the following assumptions about our generated influence network for computer simulation.
We assume that every individual $i$ in a population of size $N$ has $n_i$ neighbours who they can influence, where 
$n_i$ is drawn from an \textit{influence distribution} $p(n)$ with known average $n_{avg}$ that is much less than the population size $n_{avg} \ll N$.
Of note is that $n_i$ refers not to the number of individuals that $i$ knows but the number of 
other individuals they can influence due to different factors such as their character, expertise, reputation and community.
Additionally, we explore the scenario where individual influence is unidirectional, meaning 
an individual $i$ can influence its neighbour $j$ but $j$ cannot influence $i$, and 
bidirectional, meaning if $i$ can influence its neighbour $j$ then $j$ can influence $i$. 
This is to represent scenarios where an individual follows other individuals such as Instagram 
influencers where influence is spread in one direction, and when individuals can influence each other such as within a family.

To describe the \textit{influence distribution}, we use two common random graph models which contain properties similar to real social networks called Poisson Random Graphs and Scale-Free Networks.


\subsubsection{Poisson Random Graph}
The Poisson random graph model is a simple random graph model where the influence distribution $p(n)$ is Poisson meaning $p(n) \sim Poisson(\lambda)$ with $\lambda$ representing the average number of neighbours. In a world described by a Poisson random graph, the network exhibits no structure meaning influence connections between neighbours are random. 
Additionally, the influence distribution has little variation around its average meaning individuals who are more influential generally aren't exceptionally more influential.
With this model, connections can be either one way or two way.
Consequently, this influence distribution can model worlds where the spread of influences are bidirectional or unidirectional.
% Consequently, this influence distribution can model worlds where influences are bidirectional, meaning neighbours can influence each other, and worlds where influence is unidirectional, meaning an individual can influence a neighbour but they may not necessarily influence them.

\subsubsection{Scale-Free Networks}
The scale-free random graph model is a common model which is used to simulate a network that is more reminiscent of a social network. 
Specifically, the influence distribution $p(n)$ follows a power law distribution meaning $p(n) \sim n^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha$.
Unlike the Poisson random graph, scale-free networks contain large hubs which represent people who are connected to a a significantly larger number of people than the average person. 
Using this model, we can more closely explore how people who can influence a larger proportion of the community compare with the average person.


\subsection{Influentials}
The characteristics of influentials is not well-defined and often described as a group who can influence an exceptional number of peers.
For our analysis, we focused on seeing whether relative high number of neighbours is a characteristic of influential people by analysing the degree of influence of subsets of the simulated population based off the number of connections of each individual.
Specifically, we analysed the following groups based off the number of connections
\[ 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 95-100, n_{norm} \]
where 0-5 represents the people in the simulated data who are in the top $5\%$ ranked by number of connections and $n_{norm}$ represents the subset of the population who are at most half a standard deviation away from the average degree $n_{avg}$ of the network.




\subsection{Influence Dynamics}
For our model of influence, we implemented the following algorithm below to simulate the spread of influence\cite{github}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate a graph $G$ (Poisson/Scale-Free) of $N$ nodes, where $n_{avg}$ is known.
    \item Assign nodes to the following groups 0-5,\dots,95-100,$n_{norm}$.
    \item For each group, simulate the spread of influence for each node in the group according to the following algorithm. (Spread of influence from a single node).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Set all nodes to state $0$ except for the initial node which is set to $1$.
        \item Simulate the spread of influence for this initial state with known threshold $\phi$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

Our measure of interest is the cascade size (proportion of network influenced) that can be generated by an individual within each group.
This model allows for both local and global cascades. 
Local cascades only affect a small number of individuals that are typically close to the initial influencing node. 
In contrast, global cascades can affect an exceptional number of individuals and are usually limited by the size of the population.
With this measurement, a comparison between groups can be quantified the average cascade size for each group.
Additionally, it was found that the cascade size was invariant of the population size so a population of $N=100$ was chosen due to computational limitations. Our simulations was performed for $\phi= 0.05,0.10,0.15,0.18,0.20,0.25,0.50$ and for consistency each simulation was repeated $100$ times.
 
\subsection{The Cascade Window}
The first observation made from our simulations was that the ability for a node to initiate a cascade depended significantly on the average degree for all tested networks independent of groups.
Specifically, each degree distribution, choice of $\phi$ and had an interval for $n_{avg}$ denoted as the \textit{cascade window} where local and global cascades are possible as seen in Figure \ref{Phi10} and \ref{Phi18}.
Outside this window, $n_{avg}$ is either too small or too high.
When $n_{avg}$ is too small, even though individuals are more susceptible to innovations the network lacks connections to reach many of these individuals.
When $n_{avg}$ is too high the network is highly connected and the higher number of activated neighbours needed to influence an individual means the initial influenced individual is unable to propagate innovations.
Additionally, while the cascade window shifts with the choice of $\phi$, the relationship between population groups remain relatively similar as seen in Figure \ref{Phi10} and \ref{Phi18}.
From this, we can conclude that the role of an individual in spreading innovations on a population depends much more on the network structure rather than the individual's personal degree of influence.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Report/figs/SFRGRG10.png}
    \caption{Proportion of network influenced across different average degrees and different degree distributions with $\phi = 0.10$.}
    \label{Phi10}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Poisson and Scale-Free Influence Distributions}
The second point of interest is the comparison of cascade size between groups and influence distributions. 
Between the directed and undirected Poisson random graph, there did not appear to be any noticeable difference in the cascade window, multiplier or cascade size across groups as seen in Figure \ref{Phi10}, \ref{Phi18}, and \ref{Mult18}.
This suggests that unidirectional and bidirectional influence relationships do not alter the spread of influence. 
Rather, it depends on the influence distribution itself which in this case is the same.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Report/figs/SFRGRG18.png}
    \caption{Proportion of network influenced across different average degrees and different degree distributions with $\phi = 0.18$.}
    \label{Phi18}
\end{figure}

In both the Poisson random graph and scale-free network, the higher-degree groups (0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20) consistently had a higher cascade size while 95-100 consistently had a relatively smaller cascade size as illustrated in Figure \ref{Phi10} and \ref{Phi18}.
This result between groups can be associated to how being more connected (higher degree) leads to greater opportunities to influence others (higher cascade sizes) rather than the influence distribution.
Additionally, the 95-100 group can reach fewer neighbours and these neighbours are more likely to have more neighbours so they would be less susceptible to being influenced.
As the normal group generally had a cascade size lower than the higher-degree groups in both influence distributions, the relative cascade difference between higher-degree groups and the normal groups was found to quantify this difference as seen in Figure \ref{Mult18}.
In the scale-free network, every higher-degree group compared to the normal group had a multiplier significantly greater than $1$ within the cascade window for all $\phi$.
This suggests that higher-degree groups are much more influential than the average node and play a significant role in contributing to cascades of influence.
However, the multiplier in the Poisson random graph is much more modest. In Figure \ref{Mult18}, while the multiplier peaks at around $3.8$ meaning the 0-5 cascade is typically $3.8$ times the normal group, outside the peak of the cascade window the multiplier is much more modest suggesting that the higher-degree groups are not as significantly influential compared with the average node.
These results give mixed support for the influential hypothesis as it showcases for scale-free networks the larger role of influentials in cascades whereas in Poisson random graphs influentials have a more modest success in initiating the spread of influence.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Report/figs/Multiplier18.png}
    \caption{Comparison of relative cascade size between different population groups for $\phi = 0.18$. This is found by dividing cascade size between two groups. }
    \label{Mult18}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation on Real Social Networks}
Our simulation was applied on two different social networks. 
Advogato \cite{advogato} is a social community platform  where (undirected) links represent relationships between people and contained approximately $5000$ nodes. 
Facebook \cite{facebook} is a social network where (undirected) links represent friendships between people and contained approximately $4000$ nodes.
Both networks represent populations where the spread of influence can be thought of as the spread of ideas amongst friends.
Separating the nodes using the same population grouping as described above and running our simulation for the aforementioned $\phi$ values, we arrived at the results in Figure \ref{RealDat}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Report/figs/RealDat.png}
    \caption{Application of influence simulation on two real social networks (Facebook and Advogato). The top row shows the cascade size across different $\phi$. The bottom row shows the relative cascade size between different population groups.}
    \label{RealDat}
\end{figure}

In the Facebook data, the normal group consistently outperforms all other groups in initiating cascades unlike in either of our models as seen in the Figure\ref{RealDat} (top-left).
Interestingly the 95-100 group performs similarly to the higher-degree group.
In contrast, the relative position of groups in the Advogato data is reminiscent of the Poisson (and to some extent the scale-free) as seen in Figure \ref{RealDat} (top-right).
Looking at the multiplier plots, we can see that the multiplier is generally small in both social networks (ignoring the large spike in the Facebook multiplier (bottom-left) due to a larger drop in normal cascade relative to other groups for $\phi=0.18$).
These results support the idea that higher-degree groups may not always play a large role in initiating cascades with the Facebook network showing the biggest cascades coming from the normal group while in the Advogato network there only appears to be a modest increase in influence for higher-degree groups.

\section{Conclusion}

In this report, it was found through simulation that an individual's role in global cascades depended more on the structure of interpersonal connections within a population rather than their degree of influence.
Specifically, there are networks (Poisson, Advogato and Facebook) where the number of neighbours that an individual can directly influence does not play a significant role in contributing to their ability to initiate or contribute to a cascade.
In other cases (scale-free), influential individuals play a much bigger role in initiating and spreading influence throughout the population. 
While our models are a simplification of real influence networks, the results suggest a reexamination of the influence hypothesis, and motivates the exploration of other characteristics and attributes of influential individuals and the network structures that allow for these cascades.
